          Open OnDemand is an NSF-funded open-source HPC portal based on OSCâ€™s
          original OnDemand portal. The goal of Open OnDemand is to provide an
          easy way for system administrators to provide web access to their HPC
          resources, including, but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plugin-free web experience</li>
          <li>Easy file management</li>
          <li>Command-line shell access</li>
          <li>
            Job management and monitoring across different batch servers and
            resource managers
          </li>
          <li>Graphical desktop environments and desktop applications</li>

        <p>
          The Open OnDemand team welcomes and encourages opportunities to
          collaborate on proposals with members of our community in response a
          variety of solicitations. Examples of potential collaboration roles
          our team can have include developing and delivering related client
          education and training programs, and providing extended support
          services for software deployment and custom workflow development.
          Please contact us via the news list if you would like to discuss a
          potential collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please consider contributing to the code repository on Github. Since
          January 2016 there have been over 8,000 commits to the code base, but
          we can always use additional development help!

          <a href="https://trustedci.org/">Trusted CI</a> , the NSF
          Cybersecurity Center of Excellence conducted an in-depth vulnerability
          assessment of Open OnDemand, completing it in December 2018. This
          assessment included a careful review of the code, increasing our
          confidence in its security. The Ohio Supercomputing Center addressed
          the implementation issues (bugs) that were found during this review,
          producing a more robust revision of Open OnDemand.
