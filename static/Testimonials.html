    comments from our engaged community!

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I will say as well, from a systems administration perspective, that based
      on my experience deploying application stacks like this, OOD appears to be
      a very high quality suite of software. Several times in working with OOD,
      I have been pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful the architecture is.

      We are really excited about launching this service and the impact it will
      have on our users - its a very significant modernization of our interface.

      Over all, the application works great. It is exactly what we want to see
      as a modernization of the HPC user experience.

      I'm happy to say that we are now using it in production this semester, and
      our faculty and students love it!

      We love the interface and all of the tools in OOD. It seems to provide
      almost every feature that a user would need to use their HPC environment.

      I’m very optimistic that OnDemand will make our compute resources much
      more accessible to broader audience - thank you for sharing it.

      Thanks for putting together what looks like it's going to be an extremely
      useful tool for our users!

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      First of all, a BIG thanks to you for making OnDemand - both me and our
      users love it! We have a big biology community among our users and
      anything that makes it easier to overcome "the slurm hump" is a big help
      with users who are not computer- and linux- savvy.

      It does look like it could be a really useful tool (great work by those
      involved!)

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I have a cynical engineer whose default evaluation is ‘this sucks’. After
      launching Open OnDemand, he said, ‘this is not bad!

      OnDemand makes our efforts and computing resources significantly more
      valuable, and enables us to reach new communities of users.
