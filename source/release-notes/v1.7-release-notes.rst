Upgrading from v1.6
-------------------

.. warning::

  If upgrading from OnDemand 1.3.x or older you must upgrade to 1.6.x before upgrading to 1.7.

.. warning::

  As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the *production* instance.

.. warning::

  Because of a change in Passenger versions and Ruby versions it is necessary that all PUNs running before the upgrade be restarted after the upgrade. It's recommended to schedule an short outage of your OnDemand instance to perform this upgrade.

.. warning::

  Due to changes with ``ood-portal-generator`` it is necessary to run ``update_ood_portal`` with ``--force`` flag after upgrading to OnDemand 1.7. The RPM upgrade will generate ``/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d/ood-portal.conf.new``.
  If there are custom changes made to ``/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d/ood-portal.conf`` it will be necessary to merge those changes in after running ``update_ood_portal --force``.

#. Update OnDemand release RPM

#. Force all PUNs to restart

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo /opt/ood/nginx_stage/sbin/nginx_stage nginx_clean -f

#. Optionally remove old dependencies from prior versions of OOD if they are not used by other applications.

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum remove rh-ruby24\* rh-nodejs6\* rh-git29\*

Details
-------

Support running OnDemand with SELinux
.....................................

Beta support for running OnDemand with SELinux has been added. Support is enabled by installing the ``ondemand-selinux`` package. For details see :ref:`ood_selinux`

.. warning::

  If the ``ondemand-selinux`` package was installed from the OnDemand 1.6 release there are several changes that must be addressed manually.  Several SELinux booleans were enabled by the ``ondemand-selinux`` package and are no longer needed by OnDemand. The following SELinux booleans can be disabled if not used outside OnDemand:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo setsebool -P httpd_execmem=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_unified=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_read_user_content=off


Update Passenger and NGINX dependencies
.......................................

Passenger has been upgraded from ``5.3.7`` to ``6.0.4``. NGINX has been upgraded from ``1.14.0`` to ``1.17.3``.


Update Ruby and NodeJS dependencies
...................................

The Ruby version used by OnDemand has been upgraded from ``2.4`` to ``2.5``. The NodeJS version used by OnDemand has been upgraded from ``6`` to ``10``.

Drop EL6 and add EL8 support
............................

OnDemand has dropped support for CentOS/RedHat 6 and added support for CentOS/RedHat 8.


Added the Linux Host Adapter
............................

Support for running jobs directly on Linux hosts has been added. This means interactive 
jobs can now run on a login node instead of through a batch scheduler.

See the documentation for the :ref:`resource-manager-linuxhost`. for more details.

Show account balance warnings
.............................

The dashboard can now show account balance warnings if the users' account balance
is some threshold.

See :ref:`these docs <balance-warnings-on-dashboard>` for more details on how to 
enable this feature.

Job Composer and Active Jobs match Dashboard Branding
.....................................................

The Job Composer and Active Jobs apps' top navigation bar now share the same branding
scheme configured for the dashboard. 

There's no additional configuration required for this other than what's documented 
:ref:`here <branding>`.

Maintenance mode
................

OOD can be put into 'maintenance mode' where it serves a static page to either all
users or a subset (staff on a VPN for example).  This static page informs users
that maintenance is underway while administrators perform disruptive tasks.

See :ref:`these docs <maintenance-mode>` on how to configure and enable this feature.

Titles for Files menu entries
.............................

The shortcuts in the files dropdown menu can now show an optional title along with the 
directory path. The :ref:`original documentation <add-shortcuts-to-files-menu>` on this 
feature has been updated to reflect the new options.


Documentation for Keycloak as identity broker with CILogon and Keycloak with Duo 2FA
....................................................................................

Documentation for Keycloak as identity broker with CILogon has been added in the documentation
entitled ':ref:`authentication-tutorial-oidc-keycloak-rhel7-configure-cilogon`'.

Documentation for Keycloak with Duo two factor authentication has been updated in the documetnation
entitled ':ref:`authentication-duo-2fa-with-keycloak`'.

Add Grafana support for ActiveJobs app
......................................

OnDemand's ActiveJobs app can display graphs for jobs that are pulled from Grafana.
Details on how to configure Grafana support are in :ref:`these docs <grafana-support>`.

Improvements to ood-portal-generator
....................................

The ood-portal-generator app has been rewritten in Ruby and extensive testing added.
Checksums generated for ``ood-portal.conf`` now exclude comments.

Add an ssh wrapper to the shell app
...................................

An ssh wrapper script can now be used instead of just the ``ssh`` command in the
shell app.  See how to configure this :ref:`here <ssh-wrapper>`.

Regenerate ood-portal.conf with every apache restart
....................................................

Systemd will now regenerate the ood-portal.conf before every apache restart.  This means
administrators can now edit the ``ood_portal.yml`` configuration and then restart httpd
directly without having to do the additional step of running the ``ood-portal-generator``.

Apache httpd will read the new configuration, because a new ood-portal.conf will have
been written just before restarting.

However you will have to follow the upgrade  instructions (above), and then this will
be available.  Specifically updating the ood portal through
``sudo /opt/ood/ood-portal-generator/sbin/update_ood_portal --force``.

This feature relies on checksums generated by ``ood-portal-generator``.  If the checksums
differ (i.e., ood-portal.conf has been edited by hand, outside of the ood-portal-generator
program) this will fail and you'll have to force an update through ``update_ood_portal --force``.

Support sanitizing job names
............................

Administrators can now set the ``OOD_JOB_NAME_ILLEGAL_CHARS`` environment variable to prevent
characters from being used in job names.  For example if you do not want to use ``/`` in job
names (as is the case with some :ref:`Grid Engine <resource-manager-sge>` versions) you would
set ``OOD_JOB_NAME_ILLEGAL_CHARS: '/'`` in the ``pun_custom_env`` attribute of ``nginx_stage.yml``.

nginx_clean support for a specific user
.......................................

The ``nginx_stage nginx_clean`` command now supports a ``-u`` or ``--user`` option so it may
kill a specific users' PUN. For example ``nginx_stage nginx_clean -u johndoe`` would only
kill johndoe's PUN and disregard all the others.

Dashboard now alerts on malformed cluster configs
.................................................

Prior to 1.7 the dashboard would not start if there was a cluster cluster definition file 
(the files in ``/etc/ood/config/clusters.d/``) that had invalid yaml. 

The dashboard now handles this gracefully and shows an error message to the user stating that
this file is unusable and should indicate the line of the file that is problematic.

Job composer now shows suggested scripts
........................................

When changing the job script in the job composer the user is now presented with a dropdown of
'Suggested Files' first along with 'Other valid files'.

Files in folder will be suggested if they match any of these criteria:

1. Have one of these extensions: ".sh", ".job", ".slurm", ".batch", ".qsub", ".sbatch", ".srun", ".bsub"
2. The file starts with a shebang line (#!)
3. Has a resource manager's directive (#PBS, #SBATCH, #BSUB or #$) in the first 1000 characters.

Other valid files only have to meet a size requirement of less than ``OOD_MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE_KB`` which
defaults to 65 (meaning 65 kb).

Disable ssh to compute node link in BC card
...........................................

Administrators can now disable the link that appears in the batch connects' card to ssh into the compute 
node that the job is running on. This is helpful for sites that don't allow regular users to shell into 
compute nodes.

To do so, simply set ``OOD_BC_SSH_TO_COMPUTE_NODE=0`` (or 'false' or 'off') in ``/etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/env``.
